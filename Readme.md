# clojureshtein

Clojureshtein will be a small library that calculates similarity between two
strings calculating their Levenshtein distance.

Really? It's just a way to learn Clojure by implementing a simple algorithm I
learned at Stanford's [Natural Language Processing](http://nlp-class.org)
class :)

## Usage
